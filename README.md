# Parametrized vertex cover
### Written in Java
***This project was done as a mini-project as part of "Complexity of parametrized algorithms" course , grade: 95***

Implementation of parametrized algorithm to vertex cover problem.

Based on algorithms from the book: [Parameterized Algorithms](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~malcin/book/parameterized-algorithms.pdf) 

Parametrized algorithms enable analyzing running time as function of the input size and one or more parameters of the input instance.

In this project, there are two different implementations of parametrized algorithms to the vertex cover problem, that known as NP-hard problem.

Each implementation demonstrates one of the following techniques:

1. Basic kernelization 

2. Branching (Bounded search trees) combined with kernelization
